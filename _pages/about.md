Software developer and data scientist with 9 years of research experience working on several 
interdisciplinary laboratories. 6 years of experience analyzing brain imaging data using advanced
statistical methods, machine learning, and AI models. 4+ years of experience as a Python developer, 
collaborating on several open-sources packages. 

I am excited to apply my problem-solving, software development skills, curiosity, and passion to 
the domain of signal and image processing, especially for large and complex datasets.
