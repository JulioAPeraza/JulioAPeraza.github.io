    abstract = "{Macroscale gradients have emerged as a central principle for understanding functional brain organization. Previous studies have demonstrated that a principal gradient of connectivity in the human brain exists, with unimodal primary sensorimotor regions situated at one end and transmodal regions associated with the default mode network and representative of abstract functioning at the other. The functional significance and interpretation of macroscale gradients remains a central topic of discussion in the neuroimaging community, with some studies demonstrating that gradients may be described using meta-analytic functional decoding techniques. However, additional methodological development is necessary to fully leverage available meta-analytic methods and resources and quantitatively evaluate their relative performance. Here, we conducted a comprehensive series of analyses to investigate and improve the framework of data-driven, meta-analytic methods, thereby establishing a principled approach for gradient segmentation and functional decoding. We found that a two-segment solution determined by a k-means segmentation approach and an LDA-based meta-analysis combined with the NeuroQuery database was the optimal combination of methods for decoding functional connectivity gradients. Finally, we proposed a method for decoding additional components of the gradient decomposition. The current work aims to provide recommendations on best practices and flexible methods for gradient-based functional decoding of fMRI data.}",

    abstract = {Background Population-based neuroscience offers opportunities to examine important but understudied sociocultural factors such as acculturation. Acculturation refers to the extent to which an individual retains their cultural heritage and/or adopts the receiving society’s culture and is particularly salient among Hispanic/Latinx immigrants. Specific acculturative orientations have been linked to vulnerability to substance use, depression, and suicide and are known to influence family dynamics between caregivers and their children. Methods Using data from first- and second-generation Hispanic/Latinx caregivers in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (N = 1057), we examined how caregivers’ acculturative orientation affects their mental health, as well as the mental health and brain function of their children. Neuroimaging analyses focused on regions associated with self- and affiliation-based social processing (ventromedial prefrontal cortex, insula, and temporoparietal junction). Results We identified 2 profiles of caregiver acculturation: bicultural (retains heritage culture while adopting U.S. culture) and detached (discards heritage culture and rejects U.S. culture). Bicultural caregivers exhibited fewer internalizing and externalizing problems than detached caregivers; furthermore, youth exhibited similar internalizing effects across caregiver profiles. In addition, youth with bicultural caregivers displayed increased resting-state brain activity (i.e., fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations and regional homogeneity) in the left insula, which has been linked to psychopathology; however, differences in long-range functional connectivity were not significant. Conclusions Caregiver acculturation is an important familial factor that has been linked to significant differences in youth mental health and insula activity. Future work should examine sociocultural and neurodevelopmental changes across adolescence to assess health outcomes and determine whether localized, corticolimbic brain effects are ultimately translated into long-range connectivity differences.}

    abstract = { Introduction:Psychological factors have been associated with knee osteoarthritis pain severity and treatment outcomes, yet their combined contribution to phenotypic heterogeneity is poorly understood. In particular, empirically derived psychological profiles must be replicated before they can be targeted or considered for treatment studies. The objectives of this study were to (1) confirm previously identified psychological profiles using unsupervised clustering methods in persons with knee osteoarthritis pain, (2) determine the replicability of profiles using supervised machine learning in a different sample, and (3) examine associations with clinical pain, brain structure, and experimental pain.Methods:Participants included two cohorts of individuals with knee osteoarthritis pain recruited as part of the multisite UPLOAD1 (n = 270, mean age = 56.8 ± 7.6, male = 37\%) and UPLOAD2 (n = 164, mean age = 57.73 ± 7.8, male = 36\%) studies. Similar psychological constructs (e.g. optimism, coping, somatization, affect, depression, and anxiety), sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and somatosensory function were assessed across samples. UPLOAD2 participants also completed brain magnetic resonance imaging. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis was first conducted in UPLOAD1 data to derive clusters, followed by supervised linear discriminative analysis to predict group membership in UPLOAD2 data. Associations among cluster membership and clinical variables were assessed, controlling for age, sex, education, ethnicity/race, study site, and number of pain sites.Results:Four distinct profiles emerged in UPLOAD1 and were replicated in UPLOAD2. Identified psychological profiles were associated with psychological variables (ps < 0.001), and clinical outcomes (ps = 0.001–0.03), indicating good internal and external validation of the cluster solution. Significant associations between psychological profiles and somatosensory function and brain structure were also found.Conclusions:This study highlights the importance of considering the biopsychosocial model in knee osteoarthritis pain assessment and treatment. }

    abstract={BackgroundAutonomic dysregulation may lead to blunted sympathetic reactivity in chronic pain states. Autonomic responses are controlled by the central autonomic network (CAN). Little research has examined sympathetic reactivity and associations with brain CAN structures in the presence of chronic pain; thus, the present study aims to investigate how chronic pain influences sympathetic reactivity and associations with CAN brain region volumes.MethodsSympathetic reactivity was measured as change in skin conductance level (ΔSCL) between a resting reference period and walking periods for typical and complex walking tasks (obstacle and dual-task). Participants included 31 people with (n = 19) and without (n = 12) chronic musculoskeletal pain. Structural 3 T MRI was used to determine gray matter volume associations with ΔSCL in regions of the CAN (i.e., brainstem, amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex).ResultsΔSCL varied across walking tasks (main effect p = 0.036), with lower ΔSCL in chronic pain participants compared to controls across trials 2 and 3 under the obstacle walking condition. ΔSCL during typical walking was associated with multiple CAN gray matter volumes, including brainstem, bilateral insula, amygdala, and right caudal anterior cingulate cortex (p’s < 0.05). The difference in ΔSCL from typical-to-obstacle walking were associated with volumes of the midbrain segment of the brainstem and anterior segment of the circular sulcus of the insula (p’s < 0.05), with no other significant associations. The difference in ΔSCL from typical-to-dual task walking was associated with the bilateral caudal anterior cingulate cortex, and left rostral cingulate cortex (p’s < 0.05).ConclusionsSympathetic reactivity is blunted during typical and complex walking tasks in persons with chronic pain. Additionally, blunted sympathetic reactivity is associated with CAN brain structure, with direction of association dependent on brain region. These results support the idea that chronic pain may negatively impact typical autonomic responses needed for walking performance via its potential impact on the brain. }

    abstract="{Somatosensory function is critical for successful aging. Prior studies have shown declines in somatosensory function with age; however, this may be affected by testing site, modality, and biobehavioral factors. While somatosensory function declines are associated with peripheral nervous system degradation, little is known regarding correlates with the central nervous system and brain structure in particular. The objectives of this study were to examine age-related declines in somatosensory function using innocuous and noxious stimuli, across 2 anatomical testing sites, with considerations for affect and cognitive function, and associations between somatosensory function and brain structure in older adults.A cross-sectional analysis included 84 “younger” (n = 22, age range: 19–24 years) and “older” (n = 62, age range: 60–94 years) healthy adults who participated in the Neuromodulatory Examination of Pain and Mobility Across the Lifespan study. Participants were assessed on measures of somatosensory function (quantitative sensory testing), at 2 sites (metatarsal and thenar) using standardized procedures, and completed cognitive and psychological function measures and structural magnetic resonance imaging.Significant age × test site interaction effects were observed for warmth detection (p = .018, ηp2= 0.10) and heat pain thresholds (p = .014, ηp2= 0.12). Main age effects were observed for mechanical, vibratory, cold, and warmth detection thresholds (ps \\&lt; .05), with older adults displaying a loss of sensory function. Significant associations between somatosensory function and brain gray matter structure emerged in the right occipital region, the right temporal region, and the left pericallosum.Our findings indicate healthy older adults display alterations in sensory responses to innocuous and noxious stimuli compared to younger adults and, furthermore, these alterations are uniquely affected by anatomical site. These findings suggest a nonuniform decline in somatosensation in older adults, which may represent peripheral and central nervous system alterations part of aging processes.}",

    abstract = {In this work, we propose a natural model for information flow in the brain through a neural message-passing dynamics on a structural network of macroscopic regions, such as the human connectome (HC). In our model, each brain region is assumed to have a binary behavior (active or not), the strengths of interactions among them are encoded in the anatomical connectivity matrix defined by the HC, and the dynamics of the system is defined by the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm, working near the critical point of the network. We show that in the absence of direct external stimuli the BP algorithm converges to a spatial map of activations that is similar to the Default Mode Network (DMN) of the brain, which has been defined from the analysis of functional MRI data. Moreover, we use Susceptibility Propagation (SP) to compute the matrix of long-range correlations between the different regions and show that the modules defined by a clustering of this matrix resemble several Resting State Networks (RSN) determined experimentally. Both results suggest that the functional DMN and RSNs can be seen as simple consequences of the anatomical structure of the brain and a neural message-passing dynamics between macroscopic regions. With the new model, we explore predictions on how functional maps change when the anatomical brain network suffers structural alterations, like in Alzheimer’s disease and in lesions of the Corpus Callosum. The implications and novel interpretations suggested by the model, as well as the role of criticality, are discussed.},
